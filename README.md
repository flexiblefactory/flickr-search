Demo is here [http://flexiblefactory.co.uk/flickr-search/](http://flexiblefactory.co.uk/flickr-search/)

NB: description, author and tags have been omitted as the search API does not return any of these.

The 'feed' does, but doesn't support paging, and also does not include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header.

from [https://stackoverflow.com/a/42887045/617027](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42887045/617027):

> But `http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne` isn’t actually intended to be used with the Fetch API or XHR, so the response it sends back doesn’t include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header.
>
> Per the CORS protocol, to a browser the lack of that Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header means “Don’t expose this response to any client-side JavaScript running in a web app”.

I could have used the feed but in order to support paging, and to avoid the use of the legacy 'JSONP' callback technique, I decided to use the search api.

The project uses [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The rest of this readme document was generated by CRA.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
